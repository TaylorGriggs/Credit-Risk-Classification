# Credit-Risk-Classification

## Overview
The goal of this challenge is to assess and understand a credit rick based on lending activity and historical data to indentify the credit worthiness of borrower.
In this, we will use ML to model the data.

## Results
We were able to decipher with certainty what a healthy loan borrow persona equated to, with 85% accuracy of what a high risk borrow persona looked it.

## Summary
Utilizing the model and the data set before us we can accurately predict 99% of the loans in the given lending activity. 
Although the loan accuracy faultered on the high risk, the total sample gave a strong prediction of accuracy.
